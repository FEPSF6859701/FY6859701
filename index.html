Augmented Reality (AR) is a cutting-edge technology that integrates digital content into the real-world using devices such as smartphones, tablets, or head-mounted displays.
By enhancing the physical environment with interactive, computer-generated elements, AR creates immersive learning experiences that engage users in unique ways.
This article examines the applications of AR in the field of medical science, with a focus on how it helps students and professionals better understand and visualize human anatomy. 
From enhancing spatial awareness to providing hands-on simulations, AR is transforming how medical education is delivered. By blending technology and education, 
AR can reshape the way medical professionals are trained, leading to improved outcomes for students and patients alike.

The term “Augmented Reality” (AR) was first introduced in 1992 by Caudell and Mizell. They developed a system to help airplane factory workers by displaying wire bundle assembly instructions
on a see-through head-mounted display (HMD). However, the idea of AR had already been anticipated as far back as the 1960s. Ivan Sutherland, often referred to
as the "father of computer graphics," wrote about a concept called "The Ultimate Display," which imagined interactive, immersive virtual experiences. A few years later,
in 1968, he created the first head-mounted display. This early HMD included features like head tracking and see-through optics, laying the foundation for AR technology. 
In the 1980s and early 1990s, rapid advancements in computer science created the perfect conditions for AR to evolve into a more distinct and practical field. 
These technological developments pushed AR from being just an experimental concept to something with real-world applications. Over time, AR started to expand into different industries, 
changing how we interact with digital information and creating entirely new forms of immersive experiences. One of the earliest real-world uses of AR came in 1994, in the medical field. 
Doctors were able to use AR to see a real-time visualization of a fetus inside a pregnant patient. This was a groundbreaking moment in medical imaging, improving both diagnostic accuracy 
and the quality of prenatal care.<a href="#Dieter Schmalstieg, Tobias Hollerer (2016)"><b>[Dieter Schmalstieg, Tobias Hollerer 2016]</b></a>

Due to the fast development of AR and its wide range of practical uses there are already multiple programs being used such as Microsoft HoloLens or Magic Leap. 
One good example is the ‘Complete Anatomy’(https://3d4medical.com/student)  programme which simulates a Cadaveric lab by virtually peeling back the layers of gross anatomy, 
from the major musculoskeletal and connective systems that give our body form and function, to the diverse network of neurovascular structures such as arteries, nerves, veins, 
and lymph with Visualisation of innervations, origins and insertion points of muscles, and the ability to isolate and fade any structures enable to much more easily understand the functions of anatomical systems. 
These models of the human body could be fully simulated and interacted with on any devices this is very useful for students because it allows easy access and interactions with the models allowing them to have a 
more in-depth knowledge and experience compared to students who aren’t using AR.<a href="#Robert B. Trelease (2016)"><b>[Trelease RB 2016]</b></a> Additionally, anatomy programmes have functions that allows interactive Radio images. What’s great about 
programs like this is that they’re super accessible on various devices, which makes learning anatomy more flexible and interactive. For students, this means being able to dive deeper into anatomy without 
needing physical access to a cadaver lab, so you can practice interpreting scans and gain practical experience wherever you are.<a href="#William Albabish, Lorraine Jadeski(2018)"><B>[Albabish W, Jadeski L 2018]</B></a>

There have been several studies done to determine if AR is helpful for students Ferrer-Torregrosa et al conducted multiple experiments involving students by dividing them into groups of which, 
Group 1 was given notes and anatomical atlas images. Group 2 was given the same notes but with a video showing structures of the notes along with voice narrations. Group 3 was given notes and AR 
software which contain a book, a handheld display and a computer graphics workstation. The has images as tracking marker for a computer vison-based head tracking device, when the student views 
the imaged through the handheld device the computer calculate the students head position and creates a virtual image relative the one in the books. The result of this experiment shows that 
Group 3 has scored highest in exams with a mean score of 7.2/10 which was significantly higher than Group 2 with a mean score of 6.5/10 and Group 1 with a mean score 5.6/10. Additionally, 
76% of the students said AR would be effective for studying and 75% argued that it would improve increase the motivation and interest in the topic.<a href="#Ferrer-Torregrosa, J., Jiménez-Rodríguez, M.Á., Torralba-Estelles, J., Garzón-Farinós, F., Pérez-Bermejo, M., Fernández-Ehrling, N."><b>[Ferrer-Torregrosa et al. 2016]</b></a>. This proves 
that students find are more willing to learn in a more practical and immersive way.<a href="#Dimitrios Chytas, Elizabeth O. Johnson, Maria Piagkou, Antonios Mazarakis, George C.

        <pre>
Overall AR is proven to be extremely useful for students providing them with opportunities to learn and experience practical skills and in-depth analysis without any risk involved. 
Its advancements since the 1990s has proven in which it will continue to grow and become more and more impactful not only in medical studies but also everyday life.
